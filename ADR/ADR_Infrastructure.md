## Development
# Date: 2/28/2019

# Status: Accepted
# Decision makers: Mike Enzo, Will Hundahl, Alexander Schlesinger

#Contextual outline:
 - Our Team is Making an iOS mobile game.

#Decision:
- Swift: The choice of swift is based on several factors
  - Readability: Swift has a cleanly written syntax. The key advantage, is that as a team we can quickly review and understand the work done by other team members. In addition, two team members are relatively new to swift. The easy to read syntax will help them pick up on how the language works.

- Dynamic Libraries: Swift allows for Dynamic Libraries(executable chunks of code that can be linked to the app) cutting down on development time. Less code to perform tasks.

- Apple UIKit: Provides a robust SDK with pre-built objects optimized for iOS devices. The UI kit will allow us to develop and deploy rich, interactive features quickly.

- CoreData: This framework will allow us to manage the model layer of our app. It is developed by apple (along with our other tools) making it the easiest to integrate into our system.

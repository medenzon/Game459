## Swift Application with Apple UI Kit

*This application has been started in an Xcode development environment and provides the user with a physical interaction that is far better than that of an application or game in which one just taps or touches the screen*

The-Maze-Game is a simple maze that the user has to navigate with a ball. This game existed in the form of a wooden table that the user turned knobs to move the table around, well before iPhones were even a consideration. However, with the iPhone game the user is able to tilt their phone and control the movement of the ball through the maze. As the user does this they have to find coins and collect them before finally exiting to finish the level. 

# Requirements

- iOS10
- Swift4
- Xcode9

### Why are we doing this?

This application is intended to perform solely as a form of entertainment. The basis behind many iphone games is to provide users with the ability to entertain themselves at a moments notice by simply tapping on an app to pull up a variety of games. Traditional games such as pacMan have been converted into iphone and android apps to fill this newfound mobile gaming craze. In turn, we have set up a simple application on Appleâ€™s IOS development platform using swift, in conjunction with the Apple UI Kit to provide a seamless user experience. 

#### How do we intend to accomplish completion of this application?

Completion of this application will directly depend the size of the game created. This IOS game will focus heavily on the User experience and interation techniques employed in Apple's UI and UX kits available for developers of IOS applications. The importance of UI/UX in a game depends on the level of human interaction necessary to use the game and with a simple game (i.e The-Maze-Game) a single user visits the game breifly and often on a daily basis.

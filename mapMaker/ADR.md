# What is this?
 - This script is used to create new makes for the game. It take in the old target point and then randomly generates a new map. This is a core function of the game and allows it to be played infinitely if wished.

# Why python
  - The main reason this has been developed in python is because this is the language I'm most comfortable in. I wanted to first develop the logic in a language I'm capable in and then rebuild it in swift.

# Plan for the future
  - once again I will adapt this python code to work with the rest of the app.
